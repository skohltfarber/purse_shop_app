# purse_shop_app

We were going to the Online Shop App from The Flutter Way YouTube.
Online Shop App - Flutter UI - Speed Code https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBKzpTz65Io&t=5s

Things that I learned.
1. Stack Widget will put the furthest back first then each widget is the next layer. 

2. Padding moves you in reference inside the widget. Margins moves you in reference to the screen. The detail body has a great example. There is a container widget that has both. The child widget is moved around with the padding and the widget itself moves in reference to the margins. 

3. We used a Hero Widget and it created an animation between the image in the list to the image in the details screen. It is really neat.
